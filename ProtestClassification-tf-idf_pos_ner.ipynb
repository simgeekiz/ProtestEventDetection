    "GridSearchCV uses mean accuracy by default. However, we have chosen \"f1_macro\" scoring for hyper-parameter optimization, because mean accuracy or f1_micro is measuring the performance on the total labels, disregarding the type of the label. So, when we use accuracy or f1_micro, we get high scores because most of the labels are 0 and classifier predicts most of the labels as 0. When the accuracy score for the label 0 is high, the overall result becomes high as well, eventhough the other labels perform low. And this kind of high score doesn't mean our classifier performs better because we are actually interested in getting high scores on label 1 and 2.\n"
